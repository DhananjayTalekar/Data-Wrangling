# Data Wrangling of Laptop Prices and Used Car Pricing Datasets

## Project Overview

This project involves comprehensive data wrangling on two datasets:
1. **Laptop Prices Dataset**: Contains information about laptop specifications and their prices.
2. **Used Car Pricing Dataset**: Contains details of used cars including features such as brand, model, year, and price.

The project encompasses various data preprocessing tasks, including data cleaning, visualization, standardization, normalization, and correlation analysis to prepare the datasets for further analysis or modeling.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data inconsistencies.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Standardization and Normalization**: Standardize and normalize data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between features to understand relationships and dependencies.

## Dataset Description
